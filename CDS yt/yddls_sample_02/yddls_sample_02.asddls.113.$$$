-- In case of left outer join we need to give head.fieldname
--In case of association not andatory to give aliase name for left table
--cardinality always talk about right table
-- Number of entries will behave defferent in case 0..1 same as LOJ

-- Exposed association vs Adhoc association
/*
-- Cardinality [min..max]
◾max cannot be 0.
◾An asterisk * for max means any number of rows.
◾min can be omitted (set to 0 if omitted).
◾min cannot be *.
◾When a CDS association is used in a WHERE condition, 
  1 must be specified for max.
◾Default value [min..1] 

This work same as left outer join =>
[0..1] [1..1] => TO ONE
[0..*] [1..*] or any other => TO MANY

*/










//When to one join is used (Specifies the cardinality of a left outer join):-
/*
-> select no contain any fields from RHS then optimization take plae
-> Aggregate function  count(*) is used then optimization take plae
*/

/*
1:N left outer join  :- it will create join even we don't fetch data from rhs table
N:1 left outer join  :- it will not create join if we don't fetch data from rhs table
