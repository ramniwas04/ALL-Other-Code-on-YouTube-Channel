-- In case of left outer join we need to give head.fieldname
--In case of association not andatory to give aliase name for left table
--cardinality always talk about right table
-- Number of entries will behave defferent in case 0..1 same as LOJ










//When to one join is used (Specifies the cardinality of a left outer join):-
/*
-> select no contain any fields from RHS then optimization take plae
-> Aggregate function  count(*) is used then optimization take plae
*/

/*
1:N left outer join  :- it will create join even we don't fetch data from rhs table
N:1 left outer join  :- it will not create join if we don't fetch data from rhs table
