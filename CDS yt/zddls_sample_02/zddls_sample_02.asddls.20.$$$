/*
A: 
 The CDS view entity can be used for high volume transactions or for background transactions. 
  -> Maximum No of DDIC database tables 3,
  -> must not call any functions, 
  -> must not aggregate a large number of table rows for direct access, 
  -> must not access DDIC database tables with mixed data categories.
  -> If the underlying tables are buffered, the CDS view entity should be buffered too. 
  -> The runtime for reading a single line with a fully specified key must be less than 1 ms 
     for selecting fields from a field list or 2 ms for selecting all fields with
#B: 
 The CDS view entity can be used for transactions or for background transactions. 
  -> Maximum No of DDIC database tables 5,
  -> must not call any functions, 
  -> must not aggregate a large number of table rows for direct access, 
  -> must not access DDIC database tables with mixed data categories.
  -> If the underlying tables are buffered, the CDS view entity should be buffered too. 
  -> The runtime for reading a single line with a fully specified key must be less than 2 ms 
     for selecting fields from a field list or 5 ms for selecting all fields with

#C: 
 The CDS view entity can be used to query individual objects in transactions. 
  -> Maximum No of DDIC database tables 15,
  -> must not aggregate a large number of table rows for direct access, 
  -> must not access DDIC database tables with mixed data categories.
  -> If the underlying tables are buffered, the CDS view entity should be buffered too. 
  -> The runtime for reading a single line with a fully specified key must be less than 10 ms 
     for selecting fields from a field list or 20 ms for selecting all fields with


#D: 
 The CDS view entity can be used for analytical queries. 
 -> Maximum No of DDIC database tables 100,
 -> The performance should be checked and monitored with realistic data by a test framework.

#X: 
 The CDS view entity is designed for special application cases, such as data migration. 
 -> Maximum No of DDIC database tables more than 100,
#P: 
 The CDS view entity is used to structure hierarchies of CDS entities and must not be used outside of such a hierarchy.
 -> A CDS view entity with the quality category P is not intended for usage in business applications. 
 -> Performance checks by a test framework are not required.
