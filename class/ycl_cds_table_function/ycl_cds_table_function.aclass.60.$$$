*AMDP - Function Implementations

*◾AMDP Table Functions
*   •AMDP table functions for AMDP methods
*   •AMDP Table Functions for CDS Table Functions
**********************************************************************
*1. CDS table function can only be declared in the public visibility section
*   of a static AMDP class
*2. The line type of the return value result of an AMDP function implementation
*   for a client-dependent CDS table function does not contain a client field,
*   even though this field must be declared in the element list.
*3. An AMDP function implementation can only be associated with a single CDS table function.
*4. When an AMDP function implementation is created for a CDS table function,
*   it must already exist as an active function.
*5. When a new CDS table function is activated, an empty AMDP table function is 
*   created in the database. 
*6. This function raises an exception if a non-AMDP access is performed. 
*7. When the CDS table function is accessed by the ABAP runtime environment
*    for the first time (for example, using ABAP SQL), 
*     the AMDP function implementation implements the empty AMDP table 
*    function. 
*8. Other frameworks that evaluate CDS entities using their annotations, however, 
*    can also cause the AMDP table function to be implemented. 
*9. It is possible to access the table function in a native way only after the implementation.
